How does one become a master in the art of quality assurance? What are the various aspects ofultimate QA engineering that when put together by a single individual, will grant him or her the secretsuperpowers of utter quality assurance? Such an individual will then be very appealing for virtuallyevery company interested in creating high-quality products, assuming they can afford hiring a ninja ofcourse. In order to start answering such a profound question, this article covers one of the cornerstonesof quality assurance – how to master all the information required for assuring a high-quality release ofthe product.

## Why is mastery of information such important?

Speaking of ninjas, have you ever seen a puzzled one? Of course not, and not just because the hoodhides their facial expressions. They always seem to know what to do and how to do it, which makesthem ruthlessly effective. Working on a QA project for a complex product without having all requiredinformation is like flying an alien spaceship blindfolded when you don’t even have a driver’s license, youjust don’t do that. When you lack information you will soon find out that you cannot affect the processproperly, you lose control of the results and in general, you cannot do a good job. Be it ninjas or alienspaceships, while smashing things in a video game or in a movie can be a lot of fun, in real life whenyou have to pay customers, there are painful consequences. It feels like forgetting your partner’sbirthday – once you make that mistake you never want it to happen again.

“Know that you don’t know. This will open the door to acquiring the missing knowledge”
```
One of the things that customers are least fond of is bugs, which are unfortunately well acquainted withMurphy’s low – if something can go wrong it will go wrong. Therefore, the short-term result of lack ofinformation during the QA process is infiltration of bugs and a low-quality release of the product, whichoften leads to customer frustration and money loss. In the long term, it is a lot worse than just losingsome money, as it could lead to having a general reputation of a faulty product infested with bugs. Thiscould eventually lead to deterioration of the company brand and even bankruptcy, as customers flee tothe competition and attempt to recover prove futile.

## Acquiring the missing information

Full control of the QA process requires different types of information. These include information abouttechnology and testing, about the product and about the status of the project. Technical information isthe basis as it establishes a common language within the team and it also improves competence. Suchinformation can be found in relevant blogs, magazines, conferences, meetups, and courses. As thisstage can involve complex subjects, such as artificial intelligence, it is important to allocate enough timefor it.

Next we have product-related information. Mastering this type of information can make you a go-toperson when it comes to the product, especially if you approach this holistically and find interest inmore than just the information required for your particular tasks. The first place to look for suchinformation is in available documentation. This includes product specifications and documentation,team collaboration and Wiki-like systems such as Confluence, task management systems like Jira,professional chat systems like Slack, informative emails, test and bug documentation and evennotepads.

However, most projects today are agile and rely less on highly detailed documentation as in the oldwaterfall days. As a result, available documentation is unlikely to contain all required information and it istime to get our hands dirty through active research. This is done by poking the product, manuallymapping its entire feature set, exploring old bugs and bug-prone areas, run manual test scripts, explorewith features that are a little less mainstream and even do monkey testing through random poking. AtGett, we also care about drunk testing, where you try to operate the product as if you were drunk. Weeven allocate a monthly budget to our testers for ordering taxis through our product after their nightouts. This reveals the most surprising bugs, assuming our testers are sober enough to record them.Often times our colleagues are the ones who have the most valuable information. By identifying thosewho can provide maximum information for minimum effort and interviewing them, we can oftenleapfrog and learn a lot quicker. Once you manage to retrieve valuable undocumented information,make sure to document it in a clear and effective way, preferably in a dedicated Wiki-like system.

```query
“Monkey testing is a great way to spot those esoteric bugs. This monkey actually took aselfie and started
a whole debate about whether or not monkeys can own image copyrights. Camera testinganyone?”
```
When it comes to information about project status, there are several phases of the project, each with itsown iterative methodology of information mastery as depicted below. During pre-planning, we useavailable documentation and colleague interviews to record initial information about product definition,development, and testing. During planning stage we follow a similar procedure, only that after werecord the information there is another stage as designated by the question mark depicted below.Could you guess what that is? You can verify your answer with the image caption below. Once planningis done and actual development starts we mostly use proactive research and colleague or managerinterviewing, which become more valuable than documentation as we already have an initial version ofthe product to play with. In final stages of the project we rely mostly on active research based on themature version of the product. Lastly we record a final report of the project status for future use.

```query
“Information processing during the lifespan of a project.
The question mark refers to acknowledgement of recorded planning information with theteam”
```
## Real masters are generous and appreciate sharing
Once you have mastered the information as explained above, there is nothing like helping others whomight need it, and even becoming a focal point, as often happens with ninjas. Becoming a focal pointwill provide you with even more information, as colleagues come to consult with you and exchangeinformation. On top of using that information in your everyday tasks, sharing and teaching it helps youdevelop an even deeper understanding, and it also positions you as an expert and improves yourreputation. To lead the way, the Gett team presented this information as part of the SQA Days #22 conference held in Russia a couple of weeks ago. Besides getting great feedback for the presentation, we got to join the unofficial club of world-class QA experts. We cannot wait to meet you there as well.
